### Assignment 1 ###

#### Description
Write a program that when given an int as input (either hardcoded or entered through the prompt) will detect whether the numbers that comprise the int are in a increasing order, decreasing order, or neither by printing to the prompt the string “increasing”, “decreasing”, or “neither” respectively.

#### Grading
Each grade is awarded based on if that action is taken, where the lowest grade will trump the highest one (e.g. if a C and S are awarded, C will trump S and C will therefore be the final grade).

* Grade: C - If the int is converted to a string or an array of characters
* Grade: B - If the program does have to be rerun for each input
* Grade: A - If the the looping version of the program can be terminated when the string “end” is entered into the prompt
* Grade: S - If given the input “history”, the looping program will print out all of the inputs entered and their corresponding classifications to the prompt.
